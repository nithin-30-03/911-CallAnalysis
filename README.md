## 📌 Project Overview

The **911 Call Analysis Project** analyzes emergency call data to uncover insights that improve public safety planning and emergency response efficiency.

This project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling to identify:

- Temporal call patterns  
- Geographic hotspots  
- Emergency type distribution  
- Peak demand periods  
- Forecasted call volumes

## 🔎 Key Insights

### 📅 Temporal Analysis
- Peak hours: **6 PM – 10 PM**
- Higher call volumes during weekends
- Increased activity during summer months

### 📍 Geographic Analysis
- Identified high-risk zones (hotspots)
- Urban regions show faster response times

### 🚑 Emergency Type Distribution
- EMS accounts for majority of calls
- Fire emergencies have fastest response times

### 🤖 Predictive Modeling
- 85%+ accuracy in daily call forecasting
- Effective anomaly detection

## 📤 Outputs Generated

- `911_cleaned.csv` → Cleaned dataset  
- `911_summary_report.csv` → Statistical summary report  

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Real-time dashboard deployment  
- Integration with live emergency APIs  
- Advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Interactive web-based visualization
